                NDR Core's main functionality is to get data over an API and display it. In order to achieve this,
                you need to create a configuration on how to access your data.
                NDR Core provides multiple implementations of APIs. If your desired API is not in the list, you can
                <a href="{% url 'ndr_core:help_chapter' 'advanced' %}">write your own implementation</a>.
