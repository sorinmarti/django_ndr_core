                NDR Core can collect anonymous search statistics. You can turn on the feature and each time a user
                performs a search, the search term, time and date, general location (i.e. country of internet provider),
                and used search form are logged. You can view the logs in the administration interface, reset them
                and export them for further analysis.

                NDR Core does not log any user data when logging search statistics. No IP's or other information apart
