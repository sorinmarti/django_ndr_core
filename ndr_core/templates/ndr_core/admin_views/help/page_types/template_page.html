                Template pages are the simplest page. They let you insert static content and style it to your needs.
                Additionally, you can insert UI Elements such as slideshows or figures.
            </p>

            <h6>Inserting content</h6>
            <p class="card-text">
                The editor lets you style content in many ways. In order to get a consistent result, it is recommended
                to insert un-styled text and do the styling within ck-editor. You can add tables, links etc., all within
                the editor window. Alternatively, you style your content in word (or any other rich text processor),
                keep the layout persistent and simple and copy the text directly in the editor.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                While images can directly be copied into the ck-editor, you should use the NDR Core image manager to
                deal with images. With the help of UI Elements you can display them with a caption and automatic
                resizing.
            </p>

            <h6>Inserting UI Elements</h6>
            <p class="card-text">
                You can insert UI Elements with a simple code: <code>[[element-type|id]]</code>. After you create a UI
                Element, it shows you the specific line of code to copy into your template text. Examples are
                <code>[[slideshow|2]]</code>, <code>[[figure|23]]</code>, <code>[[card|12]]</code>. Refer to the
                <a href="{% url 'ndr_core:help_chapter' 'ui_elements' %}">UI element help</a> for more details.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                Similarly, you can use custom settings. Insert <code>[[setting|setting-name]]</code> into your template
                text to display this settings value. (Example: <code>[[setting|my_own_setting]]</code>).
