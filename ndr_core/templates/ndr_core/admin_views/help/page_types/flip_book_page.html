                A Flip Book page lets you flip through a number of pages. If, for example, you want to show case your
                data on different pages or show a number of case studies, this page type comes in handy. To create a
                flip book, you need to create a parent page of the type Flip Book and then the child pages (any type
                is fine but you'll probably only need template pages). Each child page needs to specify the flip book
                page as its parent.

                    <li>
                        Go to <a href="{% url 'ndr_core:create_page' %}">Manage Pages > Create New Page</a> to create a
                        new page. Choose flip book as its type. Fill out the required fields and create the page.

                    <li>
                        Create a number of template pages and choose the created flip book page as parent. Fill the
                        pages with content.

                    <li>
                        Your main navigation now shows the flip book page. If you click on it, the first page is shown
                        and "previous" and "next" buttons are shown.
