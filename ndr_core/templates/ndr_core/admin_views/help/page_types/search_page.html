                One main feature of NDR Core is the interface to different APIs. To access them, you need to provide
                your users with search forms. There are two types of search forms: simple search and advanced search.
                The simple form provides you with a catch-all search field and an and/or-option. The advanced search
                forms are styled in the administration interface. Additionally you can create pages with multiple search
                forms.

            <h6>Simple Search Page</h6>
            <p class="card-text">
                You need to provide an API configuration and that's it! Your search page is ready to use. You can
                change labels and help texts of the form in the <a href="{% url 'ndr_core:configure_settings' %}">
                Settings</a>.
            </p>

            <h6>Advanced Search Page</h6>
            <p class="card-text">
                You need to create one or more customised search forms (see
                <a href="{% url 'ndr_core:help_chapter' 'search' %}">Search Help</a>) which you then can select when
                creating an advanced search form. If you choose multiple forms, they are displayed in tabs.
            </p>

            <h6>Mixed Search Page</h6>
            <p class="card-text">
                If you want a simple search and a customized search on the same page, you can do that with this page type.
                They are displayed in separate tabs.
