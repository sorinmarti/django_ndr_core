                A Contact Form Page features a form where visitors can send you a message. The contact form itself
                consists of a subject line, a field for the user's email address and a text field for the message. You
                have two options how to deal with user messages. You can store them on the server and look at them there
                or you can forward them to a specified email address.

                        Go to <a href="{% url 'ndr_core:view_settings' 'mail' %}">Settings > Mail Settings</a> and set
                        the message forward option to "keep" or "forward".

                        If you choose "keep", the messages will be available in your

                        If you choose "forward", you need to specify the mail-server configuration to send the
                        messages to the specified address. The messages are still available over the
                        <a href="{% url 'ndr_core:configure_messages' %}">Inbox</a> but they are archived automatically.
