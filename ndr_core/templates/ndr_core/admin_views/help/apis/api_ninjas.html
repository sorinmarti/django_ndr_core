                 a large number of simple APIs. You'll need an API Key to use the service. You get 50K requests for
                 free, after that you need to subscribe to a premium plan. With the free plan there is no support or
                 commercial use.

                 In the context of NDR Core, API Ninjas APIs help you build test environments or demonstrate NDR Cores
                 ability to get data from somewhere and display it in a pretty form.

            <p class="card-text">
                <ul class="card-text">
                    <li>
                        Go to <a href="https://api-ninjas.com/" target="_blank">api-ninjas.com</a> and create an account.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Find your API Key in your user settings and copy it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go to <a href="https://api-ninjas.com/api" target="_blank">api-ninjas.com/api</a> and choose the
                        API you want to use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For this example we're using the <strong>country</strong> API.
                        (see <a href="https://api-ninjas.com/api/country">api-ninjas.com/api/country</a>). You see on
                        the API detail page which parameters are supported/required. For the country API there are no
                        required fields. We'll use <code>name</code> as search parameter in our example.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Go to [[create new api conf]] and create your access to the selected API. You'll need the
                        following settings:
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
