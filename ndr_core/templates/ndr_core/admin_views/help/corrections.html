                NDR Core has the option that users can mark entries for correction. This means that if they see an
                error in the database, they can mark it (and add a correction suggestion). These suggestions are
                collected and available in your administration interface. You can export them to further process
                them.

                to enable or disable the correction feature. If it is enabled, the option bar of your result template
                will contain a button to mark the entry as erroneous.
