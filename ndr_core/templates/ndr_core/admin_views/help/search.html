            <p class="card-text">
                An NDR Core Search takes search terms, searches data over an API, receives results and displays them.
                NDR Core does not provide the search index and is not the database itself. The search function is
                a graphical frontend for data which should be stored in repositories according to FAIR principles.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                An NDR Core Search consists of several parts. You need an <strong>API configuration</strong> to tell
                NDR Core where to search for data with which API. You need <strong>Search Fields</strong> which are
                composed into <strong>Search Forms</strong>. Finally you need a <strong>Result renderer</strong>
                configuration and you might want to upload <strong>Sample Data</strong> to test the result rendering.
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
                You should start with configuring your API access. Then you should think about which search fields
                you want to use. If a single catch-all search field is enough, you don't need to create a search
                form and just use the automatically generated simple search. If you want a custom form, create the
                search fields you need and create the form with these fields.
                The resulting search configuration can be added to your web site by creating a search page and
                selecting the configuration.
