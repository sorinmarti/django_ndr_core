NDR Core is developed and maintained by Sorin Marti in cooperation with `Data Futures <https://www.data-futures.org/>`_
a not-for-profit company based in Leipzig which works on redelivery and preservation technologies and infrastructure
for research data.

NDR Core is Open Source and can be found on `Github <https://github.com/sorinmarti/django_ndr_core/>`_.
