Administration interface
########################

For this document, we assume that you have your django framework installed locally and can access it via
`localhost:8000 <localhost:8000>`_ You can access the NDR Core administration interface via `localhost:8000/ndr_core/ <localhost:8000/ndr_core>`_.
You will need to login, in order to access the administration interface. When initializing your NDR Core installation,
a user named *ndr_core_admin* was created. The initial password is *ndr_core*.

**It is highly recommended that you change your password!**
