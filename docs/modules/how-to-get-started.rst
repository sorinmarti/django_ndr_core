How To Get Started
##################

Before starting, make sure NDR Core is right for you. NDR Core is meant to be a frontend
to your data but it doesn't serve as a database. The typical use case is to have a database
with a REST API and then use NDR Core to build a frontend to that API. A certain API must
be implemented in NDR Core for it to work. You can add your own API implementations to NDR
Core or use one of the existing ones.
Also, you'll need a web server to host NDR Core. This means you'll need access to a VM and
you'll need a domain name. If you want to show IIIF imagery from your data, you'll need a
IIIF service to host them.
