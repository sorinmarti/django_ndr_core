API Implementations
###################
NDR Core can be installed and configured without the need to write code.
This is extremely important because it allows users to create a website without the need to hire
a developer or to learn how to code. To implement a new API however, one needs to
write some Python code. NDR Core tries to do as much of the heavy lifting as possible and
provides two Abstract classes which need to be implemented, so an API can be
added to NDR Core.

Sharing Your API Implementation
===============================
 Create a pull request on GitHub. Your code will be reviewed and merged into the
main branch. The next version of NDR Core will feature your API implementation.
Of course, an added API implementation can be used right away after the implementation but it will
only be available to other users after the next release.
