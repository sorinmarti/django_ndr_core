Manage Pages
============
This section lets users create pages and manage the website structure.
A page is a container for web elements and can be used to create static content or to display search results.
Every page has a type which determines how the page is rendered, a title, a navigation label and several other options.

Template Pages
--------------
Template Pages are used to create static content such as a description of the project or an introduction to the data.
They can contain rich text which can be edited with the help of the CKEditor.
With the use of simple markup tags, users can create links to other pages, images or resources.
The markup tags also allow the creation of blocks which can be used to structure the content.
NDR Core can produce translated pages, so for every selected language, another rich text field is available for the translation.

Search Pages

Search Pages are used to display search forms and search results.
