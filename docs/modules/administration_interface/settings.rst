Settings
========
The settings section is used to configure various settings of the website. It features 7
subsections: Page Settings, Language Settings, HTML Header Settings, Search Settings,
Contact Form/Mail Settings, Social Media and Custom Settings. See the table below
for a description of the settings. This section also lets you change the password of the
admin user and set the website to read-only or under-construction mode.
If you activate the read-only mode, the admin interface will be set to read-only and only the
maintenance section will be available in the administration interface. If you activate the
under-construction mode, the website will display a message that the website is under
construction and no pages will be available to the users in the frontend. These settings
can be done by anyone with access to the administration interface and are not meant to
be security but convenience features.
