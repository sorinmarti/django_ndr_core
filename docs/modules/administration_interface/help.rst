Help
====
The help section is the last but not the least page of the administration interface. NDR
Core thinks about documentation in three layers: The first layer is the documentation
of the project and its source code, the second layer is the documentation for user who
need to install and set up the project. The third layer is this documentation in the
administration interface. It is structured into four sections: General, API & Search, UI &
Resources and Maintenance. The general section holds information about NDR Core
in general, about creating pages and entering content. It explains the settings and
advanced editing techniques (the markup language of NDR Core). The API & Search
section explains how to create a search configuration and has pointers on how to use
specific APIs. This section explains how to create search and result fields and how to
connect them to a search configuration. The UI & Resources section explains how to
create User Interface elements and how to use them in the static content. It also explains
how to upload images and how to change the User Interface style and colors of the frontend.
The Maintenance section explains how to manage messages sent via the contact
form and how to manage correction suggestions and search statistics.
This documentation has been written for the most part. It is not complete but is
already good enough to help users to create and maintain their projects.
